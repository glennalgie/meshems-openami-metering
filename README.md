# EIOT.Energy EMS DER/Site Controller Dev Kit - OpenAMI Metering Application

## StreetPoleEMS web dashboard (lab demo)

Operator UI served from the ESP32 (`data/index.html` over Wi‑Fi): 3D map, per-tenant relay controls, a D3 **flat-baseline stacked** timeline (optional Chart.js stacked view), and MQTT command feedback. This capture is from the **Uganda-oriented lab simulation** stack (not a 1:1 production field deployment).

## Overview
A development kit based on the ESP32S3 N16R8 DEV KIT C1 for energy management systems (EMS) with support for various communication protocols and peripherals. There are a few N16R8 40/42/44 pin layouts. Th EMS kit th \evariant where the rgbw led is top center mounted just below the WROOM ESP32S3 surface mount module. All variants will work except the pins layout differs. 

## Branch `hack-relays` (workshop / hackathon)

**Intent for this branch:** Keep **OpenAMI-style metering** as the base story, but prioritize a **simple operator path**: Modbus (or equivalent) **reads per feed**, plus **discrete relay / SSR control per customer** (8-channel I2C SSR bank on the NESL **EMS 865B**). Cloud topics and full lane-B networking stay **out of scope** until the local meter + relay loop is stable.

**Firmware in this branch:** `include/i2c_ssr_bank.h`, `src/i2c_ssr_bank.cpp`, and `I2C_SSR_*` / `PCF8574_I2C_ADDR` in `include/pins.h`. On boot, USB serial **115200** runs an **I2C scan**; keys **0-7** toggle SSR channels, **a** all off, **?** help.

**Deliverable we want by end of hack:** Documented wiring, working toggle path from firmware to SSR outputs, and a clear mapping table (customer / meter id / relay channel) for field use.

### Current Status

### 2026-06-06 Firmware/MQTT Update

- Renamed the MQTT device ID prefix from `StreetPoleEMS_` to `StreetEMS_`.
- Split MQTT publishing into per-subtopic rates: `subpanel_3Ph`, `meter_0..meter_n`, `subpanel_ENV`, `subpanel_MFR`, `subpanel_circuitsetup`, `subpanel_RCMleaks`, and `subpanel_harmonics`.
- Moved runtime status into `subpanel_ENV`, including uptime, CircuitSetup chip status, CT current samples, WiFi state/IP, and placeholder BLE/Ethernet up/down fields.
- Removed detailed harmonic arrays from `subpanel_3Ph`; detailed harmonics remain in the dedicated `subpanel_harmonics` topic.
- Expanded tenant meter publishing from 3 to 6 meters, so MQTT now emits `meter_0` through `meter_5`.
- Updated the DDS238 Modbus table for six meters using lab addresses `0x50` through `0x55`.
- Updated SunSpec model 1 options text for the 6-port CircuitSetup meter configuration.
- Fixed the local `wifi.h` naming conflict by renaming the project WiFi wrapper to `app_wifi.h` and adjusted PlatformIO library detection for Arduino `WiFi`/`Networking`.
- Deferred MCP2515 CAN object construction until after its CS pin is configured, preventing the boot-time GPIO warning on `IO 10`.

Build check: `pio run -e esp32-s3-devkitc-1` passes. Remaining known warning: `src/main.cpp` still reports an out-of-bounds `relayShadow[1][h]` write while `kBoards = 1`.

---

### MQTT Relay Command Interface

All commands publish JSON to `openami/<device_id>/cmd`. The subscriber parses the `cmd` field and dispatches to the appropriate handler.

#### Relay actuation (`cmd: "relay"`)

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `address` | int 0–7 | SSR channel (maps to `relay_rules[]` and `readings[]` index) |
| `state` | `"open"` \| `"close"` | Immediate actuation — mutually exclusive with limit fields |
| `kw_limit` | float | Trip relay when `active_power > kw_limit` (kW) |
| `kwh_limit` | float | Trip relay when `total_energy > kwh_limit` (kWh) |

Both `kw_limit` and `kwh_limit` can be set in one command. Omitting a limit field clears it to `-1` (disabled). A stored limit of `-1` is never evaluated.

```jsonc
{"cmd":"relay","address":2,"state":"close"}
{"cmd":"relay","address":2,"kw_limit":3.0}
{"cmd":"relay","address":2,"kwh_limit":150.0}
{"cmd":"relay","address":2,"kw_limit":3.0,"kwh_limit":150.0}
```

#### Other registered commands

| `cmd` | Description |
|---|---|
| `"report"` | Stub — triggers a data-model dump (not yet implemented) |
| `"meter"` | Stub — meter control (not yet implemented) |
| `"bms"` | Stub — BMS command (not yet implemented) |
| `"inverter"` | Stub — inverter command (not yet implemented) |

---

### Relay Rule Enforcement — Implementation Status

**What is implemented:**

- **`RelayRule` storage** (`include/i2c_ssr_bank.h`, `src/i2c_ssr_bank.cpp`) — per-channel struct with `kw_limit` and `kwh_limit` floats. `set_relay_rule()` / `get_relay_rule()` accessors. Persists in RAM until reset.
- **`set_i2c_ssr_channel(channel, on)`** (`src/i2c_ssr_bank.cpp`) — programmatic relay actuation via PCF8574 I2C, including active-low inversion and logical-to-bit mapping.
- **`enforce_relay_rules()`** (`src/main.cpp`) — runs every main loop iteration after readings are updated. For each channel 0–(`MODBUS_NUM_METERS`−1), compares `readings[ch].active_power` against `kw_limit` and `readings[ch].total_energy` against `kwh_limit`. On breach, calls `apply_dashboard_relay(0, ch, false)` and publishes to `openami/<device_id>/relay/trip_<ch>`.
- **MQTT poll/publish/reconnect decoupling** — `poll_mqtt()` every 10 s (`MQTTPoll_rate`), `loop_mqtt()` every 5 min (`MQTTPublish_rootrate`), `maintain_mqtt_connection()` gates a reconnect attempt before either fires.

**What is not yet implemented:**

- **Rule enforcement** — stored rules are not yet evaluated against live meter readings. A polling loop must be added to check each channel's `kw_limit` / `kwh_limit` against current readings on some cadence and open the relay when a tenant exceeds their threshold.
- **State command actuation** — the `state: open/close` relay command is parsed and stored but not yet connected to the I2C SSR control functions. Wiring to `set_i2c_ssr_channel()` is required.
- **Rule persistence** — rules are stored in RAM and lost on power cycle. For production deployments where limits must survive a reboot, rules need to be written to external storage (e.g. SPIFFS or EEPROM) and reloaded on boot.
- **No hysteresis or re-arm logic** — once a relay trips, it should stay open until manually re-closed via `{"cmd":"relay","address":N,"state":"close"}`. The enforcement implementation will need to avoid re-evaluating an already-tripped channel, and there is no automatic re-arm or dead-band around the threshold.
- **kWh enforcement uses cumulative `total_energy`** — this is a one-way ratchet. The limit fires when the meter's lifetime total crosses the threshold, not a per-session or per-billing-period accumulation. A reset mechanism (write a new threshold or clear the rule) is needed for production use.

### Known Issues

#### SHT20 Modbus Timeout — SoftwareSerial / WiFi Interrupt Contention

`src/modbus_master.cpp` uses `plerup/EspSoftwareSerial` on GPIO 6 (RX) and GPIO 7 (TX) for RS-485. On ESP32-S3 with WiFi active, the WiFi stack's high-frequency interrupts starve the SoftwareSerial GPIO ISR, causing received bytes to be missed and every poll to timeout (`err=0xE2 TIMEOUT`).

**Confirmed:**
- HW-519 TXD → GPIO 6 wire is connected (GPIO 6 idles HIGH as expected)
- RS-485 twisted pair has valid signal (verified with bridge probe)
- Both SHT20 modules (original and replacement) fail identically

**Root cause:** `EspSoftwareSerial` is not interrupt-safe alongside the ESP32-S3 WiFi stack.

**Fix:** Replace `SoftwareSerial _modbus1` with a hardware UART (`Serial1`) routed via the GPIO matrix:
```cpp
// In modbus_master.cpp, replace:
SoftwareSerial _modbus1(RS485_RX_1, RS485_TX_1);
// With:
HardwareSerial _modbus1(1);  // UART1
// And in setup_modbus_master():
_modbus1.begin(9600, SERIAL_8N1, RS485_RX_1, RS485_TX_1);
```
The ESP32-S3 GPIO matrix routes hardware UARTs to any pin, so no rewiring needed.

#### DDS238 Modbus Address Mismatch

Addresses in `src/modbus_master.cpp` are set to `0x50`, `0x51`, `0x52`. Physical meters are typically staged at `0x01`, `0x02`, `0x03`. Update before testing meters.

#### MCP2515 CAN Init Failure

`can.cpp` sets `MCP_CRYSTAL_FREQ MCP_8MHZ`. If the MCP2515 module has a 16 MHz crystal, change to `MCP_16MHZ`. Also verify SPI pins (CS=GPIO2, MISO=GPIO42, MOSI=GPIO41, SCK=GPIO8, INT=GPIO17) are correctly wired.

### IOT MUG 8-Channel I2C SSR Board

**Product:** [IOT MUG 8-Channel I2C Solid State Relay Module](https://www.iotmug.com/8-channel-i2c-solid-state-relay-module)

#### I2C Address
The board uses **0x27** (all address DIP switches ON) or **0x3F** (PCF8574A variant). Check the red DIP switch block on the board — the default out of box is **0x27**. Set `PCF8574_I2C_ADDR` in `include/pins.h` to match.

#### Wiring (BOARD_VER_V3)
| SSR Board Pin | EMS Board Connection | GPIO |
|---|---|---|
| VCC | 5V | — |
| GND | GND | — |
| SDA | SSR2 header | GPIO 14 |
| SCL | SSR1 header | GPIO 20 |

`I2C_SSR_SDA_GPIO` and `I2C_SSR_SCL_GPIO` in `include/pins.h` must match the physical wiring. Avoid GPIO46 — it has an internal pull-down that locks up the I2C bus.

#### Channel Mapping
The PCF8574 P0 bit maps to **relay 8** on the IOT MUG board (reversed order):

| Bit | Relay |
|---|---|
| P7 (bit 7) | Relay 1 |
| P6 (bit 6) | Relay 2 |
| ... | ... |
| P0 (bit 0) | Relay 8 |

The firmware uses active-low logic (`I2C_SSR_ACTIVE_LOW 1`) which matches the IOT MUG board.

### Upload & Serial Monitor (macOS)

The ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1 has **two USB-C ports**:
- **COM port** (via CH343P UART bridge) — use this for both flashing and serial monitor
- **USB port** (native ESP32-S3 USB) — not needed for normal dev use

Always use the **COM port**. The firmware has `ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT` disabled so `Serial` output goes to UART0 (COM port), keeping flash and monitor on the same connector.

If upload fails with "Resource busy", a `screen` session may be holding the port:
```bash
lsof /dev/cu.usbmodem*   # find the PID
kill <PID>
```

Flash command:
```bash
pio run -t upload --upload-port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXXX
```

Serial monitor:
```bash
screen /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXXX 115200
# Exit: Ctrl+A, K, Y
```

## Web Dashboard + GeoJSON (current hack-relays workflow)

This branch now includes an operator-focused web dashboard served by the ESP32:

- `/` serves `data/index.html` (MapLibre + D3 stacked timeline / Chart.js UI)
- `/api/dashboard` returns dashboard JSON with embedded GeoJSON features
- `/api/relay?board=<id>&channel=<id>&state=<0|1>` toggles relay state and returns command result

### Scope clarification (important)

- This dashboard is a **simulation interface running on lab equipment**.
- It is designed to represent a **real field operating context** and field topology we are connected to through an operator relationship.
- It is **not** a 1:1 production deployment of the field control stack.
- In the current lab setup, **SSR channels 0–5** on board 0 drive the IoTMug bank (three tenant households × Primary + Secondary); **SSR 6–7** are unused in this mapping. Per-house data on the map still shows all 10 homes.

### What is shown in the dashboard

- Satellite basemap with site/court geometry
- House points (10 homes) with per-house relay state color:
  - **Green** = connected / relay ON
  - **Red** = disconnected / relay OFF
- A one-day simulated timeline per house (hourly kWh values)
- Relay controls with explicit action buttons:
  - **TURN ON** (green action button)
  - **TURN OFF** (red action button)

### GeoJSON notes

- House points are emitted as proper GeoJSON Point coordinates in `[lon, lat, z]` order.
- Site outline (`court`) and **three circuit** `LineString`s come from **`Circuit1.kmz`**, **`Circuit2.kmz`**, and **`Circuit3.kmz`** (Google Earth paths). Each path is converted at build time into `include/circuit_paths_generated.h` (run `python3 scripts/kmz_to_circuit_paths.py` manually, or rely on the PlatformIO `pre:` script). Aerial ribbon segments (`courtAir`) follow the same vertices.
- The current implementation uses one StreetPoleEMS board with 10 house points for visualization.
- Relay API / MQTT `channel` is **SSR index 0–5** (not per-house index 0–9). Houses on the same secondary circuit share one SSR state on the map.

### Deployment gotcha: upload filesystem content

If `/api/dashboard` works but `/` does not load the UI, upload SPIFFS filesystem assets:

```bash
pio run -t uploadfs --upload-port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXXX
pio run -t upload   --upload-port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXXX
```

### Connect and open the dashboard HTML in your browser

After firmware + filesystem are flashed, use this quick sequence to reach `data/index.html` from a browser:

1. Connect your laptop/phone to the same Wi-Fi network as the ESP32.
2. Open serial monitor and reset the board:
   ```bash
   pio device monitor -b 115200 --port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXXX
   ```
3. Find the device IP in serial output:
   - **Right after WiFi connects**, the firmware prints one line: `wifi: <SSID>: <a.b.c.d>` (from `src/wifi.cpp`). If you opened the monitor late, **press the EN/RESET button** and scroll up to catch that line.
   - **Every few seconds** the `STATUS ...` line also includes `WiFi=up ip=<a.b.c.d>` when connected, so the address stays visible without scrolling for boot logs.
4. In a browser, open:
   - `http://<device-ip>/` (serves `data/index.html`)
   - `http://<device-ip>/api/dashboard` (raw JSON check)
5. If the API works but UI does not, run `uploadfs` again, then hard-refresh the browser.

Quick checks:
- Use plain `http://` (not `https://`).
- Make sure VPN/client isolation is off; your browser device must be on the same subnet.
- If the IP changes after reboot, reconnect with the new IP from serial logs.

## Nearly Free Energy (Uganda) site-layout reference

The current court/house layout in the dashboard is based on the Nearly Free Energy Sezibwa Homes site-layout page (Uganda), then represented in GeoJSON for this ESP32 dashboard workflow.

- Source page: https://bookstack.nearlyfreeenergy.com/books/business/page/site-layout
- In this repo, house coordinates are embedded in `src/main.cpp` and exposed through `/api/dashboard`. LV circuit polylines are authored as KMZ next to `platformio.ini`, then baked into firmware as above.

When updating site geometry, keep the source-of-truth process simple:

1. Capture site coordinates (survey/GPS or engineering drawing export)
2. Store as `lat,lon` source data
3. Convert to GeoJSON output order `lon,lat`
4. For the three map circuits, edit `Circuit1.kmz`–`Circuit3.kmz` (one `LineString` path each), then rebuild so `circuit_paths_generated.h` updates
5. Validate by opening `/api/dashboard` and confirming house placement on satellite map

(Screenshot of this UI: see **StreetPoleEMS web dashboard** at the top of this README — [`uganda_relay_latest.png`](uganda_relay_latest.png).)

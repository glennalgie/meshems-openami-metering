# EIOT.Energy EMS DER/Site Controller Dev Kit - OpenAMI Metering Application

## Overview
A development kit based on the ESP32S3 N16R8 DEV KIT C1 for energy management systems (EMS) with support for various communication protocols and peripherals. There are a few N16R8 40/42/44 pin layouts. Th EMS kit variant where the RGVW led is top center mounted just below the WROOM ESP32S3 surface mount module. All variants will work except the pins layout differs. 

### 2026-06-06 modbus-testing merge iteration

This branch keeps the `modbus-testing` refactor as the base layout and ports the simpler MQTT/metering behavior from the latest `hack-relays` fork:

- MQTT device IDs now use the `StreetEMS_` prefix.
- MQTT publishing now uses independent per-subtopic rates for MFR, ENV, CircuitSetup mapping, 3-phase totals, leakage, harmonics, and `meter_0..meter_n`.
- `subpanel_ENV` now includes runtime status fields: uptime, meter count, CT current samples, ATM90E32 board health, WiFi/Ethernet state when enabled, and placeholder BLE state.
- `subpanel_3Ph` no longer carries detailed harmonic arrays; those remain in `subpanel_harmonics`.
- The active ATM90E32 path keeps six CT channels mapped onto the standard three LV feeder phases: meters 0/3 = phase A, 1/4 = phase B, 2/5 = phase C.
- SunSpec model 1 options text now identifies the 6-port CircuitSetup meter configuration.

Deferred for a later iteration: WiFi wrapper rename, AsyncWebServer/dashboard merge, and old flat-layout `circuitsetup_meter.cpp` API/web pieces.

### Current Status

Active build flags (see `platformio.ini`): `ENABLE_OLED_DISPLAY`, `ENABLE_WIFI`, `ENABLE_MQTT`, `ENABLE_MODBUS_MASTER`, `ENABLE_DEBUG`, `METER_TYPE_ATM90E32`.

| Subsystem | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| WiFi / MQTT | ✅ Working | Connects to broker, publishes all topics |
| ATM90E32 6-Ch SPI Meter | ⚠️ Implemented / Not field-tested | New driver; CS pins GPIO 33/34 are placeholders — verify against board schematic before use. See known issue below. |
| SHT20 Temp/Humidity (Modbus) | ❌ Timeout | SoftwareSerial / WiFi interrupt contention. See known issue below. |
| DDS238 / CHD130 / DDSU666 (Modbus) | ⚠️ Supported, inactive | Addresses corrected to `0x01–0x03`. Enable by setting `METER_TYPE_DDS238` (or variant) in `platformio.ini`. |
| I2C SSR Bank (PCF8574) | ⚠️ Implemented, disabled | `ENABLE_RELAYS` is commented out in `platformio.ini`. Uncomment to activate. |
| Onboard SSR (GPIO38) | ⚠️ Implemented, disabled | Controlled by `ENABLE_RELAYS`; same flag as I2C SSR bank. |
| MCP2515 CAN | ❌ Disabled / Init failure | `ENABLE_CAN` commented out. When enabled: `Entering Configuration Mode Failure` — SPI wiring or crystal freq mismatch. See known issue below. |

### Known Issues

#### TODO: PCB 865B.4 Pin Review

The schematic review found that OLED wiring in `include/core/pins.h` appears correct for `BOARD_VER_V3`: `OLED-CS` -> GPIO17, `OLED-DC` -> GPIO18, `OLED-RST` -> GPIO8, `CLK` -> GPIO12, and `MOSI` -> GPIO11.

Do not enable OLED with the current ATM90E32 pin map yet. `ATM90E32_IC2_CS` is currently set to GPIO18, but the schematic labels GPIO18 as `OLED-DC`. For the first ATM90E32 add-on pair, the schematic appears to map `CS1-1` -> GPIO15 and `CS1-2` -> GPIO16, so `ATM90E32_IC2_CS` likely needs GPIO16 after board-level acknowledgement.

CAN also needs revalidation before enabling: current `CAN0_SI` = GPIO16 overlaps the likely ATM90E32 `CS1-2`, and `CAN0_SCK` = GPIO17 overlaps `OLED-CS`.

### IOT MUG 8-Channel I2C SSR Board

**Product:** [IOT MUG 8-Channel I2C Solid State Relay Module](https://www.iotmug.com/8-channel-i2c-solid-state-relay-module)

#### I2C Address
The board uses **0x27** (all address DIP switches ON) or **0x3F** (PCF8574A variant). Check the red DIP switch block on the board — the default out of box is **0x27**. Set `PCF8574_I2C_ADDR` in `include/pins.h` to match.

#### Wiring (BOARD_VER_V3)
| SSR Board Pin | EMS Board Connection | GPIO |
|---|---|---|
| VCC | 5V | — |
| GND | GND | — |
| SDA | SSR2 header | GPIO 14 |
| SCL | SSR1 header | GPIO 20 |

`I2C_SSR_SDA_GPIO` and `I2C_SSR_SCL_GPIO` in `include/pins.h` must match the physical wiring. Avoid GPIO46 — it has an internal pull-down that locks up the I2C bus.

#### Channel Mapping
The PCF8574 P0 bit maps to **relay 8** on the IOT MUG board (reversed order):

| Bit | Relay |
|---|---|
| P7 (bit 7) | Relay 1 |
| P6 (bit 6) | Relay 2 |
| ... | ... |
| P0 (bit 0) | Relay 8 |

The firmware uses active-low logic (`I2C_SSR_ACTIVE_LOW 1`) which matches the IOT MUG board.

#### MQTT Relay Commands

Relay commands are sent to the device command topic:

```text
openami/<device_id>/cmd
```

Direct relay actuation examples:

```json
{"cmd":"relay","address":2,"state":"open"}
```

```json
{"cmd":"relay","address":2,"state":"close"}
```

```json
{"cmd":"relay","address":15,"state":"open"}
```

Tenant relay threshold examples:

```json
{"cmd":"relay","address":2,"kw_limit":3.0}
```

```json
{"cmd":"relay","address":2,"kwh_limit":12.0}
```

```json
{"cmd":"relay","address":2,"kw_limit":3.0,"kwh_limit":12.0,"class":"essential"}
```

```json
{"cmd":"relay","address":2,"kw_limit":1.5,"class":"best_effort"}
```

```json
{"cmd":"relay","address":2,"class":"null"}
```

```json
{"cmd":"relay","address":2,"kw_limit":3.0,"warning_ms":60000,"excess_ms":120000}
```

`address` is the SSR relay id. With the default two 8-channel SSR boards, valid addresses are `0` through `15`. The first `SSR_TENANT_RELAY_COUNT` relays default to tenant disconnect outputs; remaining relays are accessory/spare outputs. Relay state and policy status are published in `subpanel_ssr`, while each `meter_N` payload includes the compact relay mapping/status for that tenant.

Supported tenant service classes are `null`, `best_effort`, `normal`, `urgent`, `important`, `essential`, and `critical`.

### Upload & Serial Monitor (macOS)

The ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1 has **two USB-C ports**:
- **COM port** (via CH343P UART bridge) — use this for both flashing and serial monitor
- **USB port** (native ESP32-S3 USB) — not needed for normal dev use

Always use the **COM port**. The firmware has `ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT` disabled so `Serial` output goes to UART0 (COM port), keeping flash and monitor on the same connector.

If upload fails with "Resource busy", a `screen` session may be holding the port:
```bash
lsof /dev/cu.usbmodem*   # find the PID
kill <PID>
```

Flash command:
```bash
pio run -t upload --upload-port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXXX
```

Serial monitor:
```bash
screen /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXXX 115200
# Exit: Ctrl+A, K, Y
```

## Features
This development kit supports multiple peripherals using the PlatformIO and Arduino framework:
- RS-485 MODBUS RTU communication (DDS238, CHD130, DDSU666 single-phase meters)
- CircuitSetup ATM90E32 6-channel SPI energy meter (3-phase / multi-CT)
- CANBUS V2.0 interface via SPI (MCP2515)

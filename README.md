# EIOT.Energy EMS DER/Site Controller Dev Kit - OpenAMI Metering Application

## StreetPoleEMS web dashboard (lab demo)

Operator UI served from the ESP32 (`data/index.html` over Wi‑Fi): 3D map, per-tenant relay controls, timelines, and MQTT command feedback. This capture is from the **Uganda-oriented lab simulation** stack (not a 1:1 production field deployment).

## Overview
A development kit based on the ESP32S3 N16R8 DEV KIT C1 for energy management systems (EMS) with support for various communication protocols and peripherals. There are a few N16R8 40/42/44 pin layouts. Th EMS kit th \evariant where the rgbw led is top center mounted just below the WROOM ESP32S3 surface mount module. All variants will work except the pins layout differs. 

## Branch `hack-relays` (workshop / hackathon)

**Intent for this branch:** Keep **OpenAMI-style metering** as the base story, but prioritize a **simple operator path**: Modbus (or equivalent) **reads per feed**, plus **discrete relay / SSR control per customer** (8-channel I2C SSR bank on the NESL **EMS 865B**). Cloud topics and full lane-B networking stay **out of scope** until the local meter + relay loop is stable.

**Firmware in this branch:** `include/i2c_ssr_bank.h`, `src/i2c_ssr_bank.cpp`, and `I2C_SSR_*` / `PCF8574_I2C_ADDR` in `include/pins.h`. On boot, USB serial **115200** runs an **I2C scan**; keys **0-7** toggle SSR channels, **a** all off, **?** help.

**Deliverable we want by end of hack:** Documented wiring, working toggle path from firmware to SSR outputs, and a clear mapping table (customer / meter id / relay channel) for field use.

### Current Status

| Subsystem | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| WiFi / MQTT | ✅ Working | Connects to broker, publishes all topics |
| I2C SSR Bank (PCF8574) | ✅ Working | 0x27, channels 0–7 toggle via serial |
| SHT20 Temp/Humidity (Modbus) | ❌ Timeout | See known issue below |
| DDS238 Energy Meters (Modbus) | ❌ Not tested | Addresses set to 0x50–0x52 (wrong); change to 0x01–0x03 to match physical meters |
| MCP2515 CAN | ❌ Init failure | `Entering Configuration Mode Failure` — SPI wiring or crystal freq mismatch |
| Onboard SSR (GPIO38) | ✅ Working | Toggles on relay loop |

### Known Issues

#### SHT20 Modbus Timeout — SoftwareSerial / WiFi Interrupt Contention

`src/modbus_master.cpp` uses `plerup/EspSoftwareSerial` on GPIO 6 (RX) and GPIO 7 (TX) for RS-485. On ESP32-S3 with WiFi active, the WiFi stack's high-frequency interrupts starve the SoftwareSerial GPIO ISR, causing received bytes to be missed and every poll to timeout (`err=0xE2 TIMEOUT`).

**Confirmed:**
- HW-519 TXD → GPIO 6 wire is connected (GPIO 6 idles HIGH as expected)
- RS-485 twisted pair has valid signal (verified with bridge probe)
- Both SHT20 modules (original and replacement) fail identically

**Root cause:** `EspSoftwareSerial` is not interrupt-safe alongside the ESP32-S3 WiFi stack.

**Fix:** Replace `SoftwareSerial _modbus1` with a hardware UART (`Serial1`) routed via the GPIO matrix:
```cpp
// In modbus_master.cpp, replace:
SoftwareSerial _modbus1(RS485_RX_1, RS485_TX_1);
// With:
HardwareSerial _modbus1(1);  // UART1
// And in setup_modbus_master():
_modbus1.begin(9600, SERIAL_8N1, RS485_RX_1, RS485_TX_1);
```
The ESP32-S3 GPIO matrix routes hardware UARTs to any pin, so no rewiring needed.

#### DDS238 Modbus Address Mismatch

Addresses in `src/modbus_master.cpp` are set to `0x50`, `0x51`, `0x52`. Physical meters are typically staged at `0x01`, `0x02`, `0x03`. Update before testing meters.

#### MCP2515 CAN Init Failure

`can.cpp` sets `MCP_CRYSTAL_FREQ MCP_8MHZ`. If the MCP2515 module has a 16 MHz crystal, change to `MCP_16MHZ`. Also verify SPI pins (CS=GPIO2, MISO=GPIO42, MOSI=GPIO41, SCK=GPIO8, INT=GPIO17) are correctly wired.

### IOT MUG 8-Channel I2C SSR Board

**Product:** [IOT MUG 8-Channel I2C Solid State Relay Module](https://www.iotmug.com/8-channel-i2c-solid-state-relay-module)

#### I2C Address
The board uses **0x27** (all address DIP switches ON) or **0x3F** (PCF8574A variant). Check the red DIP switch block on the board — the default out of box is **0x27**. Set `PCF8574_I2C_ADDR` in `include/pins.h` to match.

#### Wiring (BOARD_VER_V3)
| SSR Board Pin | EMS Board Connection | GPIO |
|---|---|---|
| VCC | 5V | — |
| GND | GND | — |
| SDA | SSR2 header | GPIO 14 |
| SCL | SSR1 header | GPIO 20 |

`I2C_SSR_SDA_GPIO` and `I2C_SSR_SCL_GPIO` in `include/pins.h` must match the physical wiring. Avoid GPIO46 — it has an internal pull-down that locks up the I2C bus.

#### Channel Mapping
The PCF8574 P0 bit maps to **relay 8** on the IOT MUG board (reversed order):

| Bit | Relay |
|---|---|
| P7 (bit 7) | Relay 1 |
| P6 (bit 6) | Relay 2 |
| ... | ... |
| P0 (bit 0) | Relay 8 |

The firmware uses active-low logic (`I2C_SSR_ACTIVE_LOW 1`) which matches the IOT MUG board.

### Upload & Serial Monitor (macOS)

The ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1 has **two USB-C ports**:
- **COM port** (via CH343P UART bridge) — use this for both flashing and serial monitor
- **USB port** (native ESP32-S3 USB) — not needed for normal dev use

Always use the **COM port**. The firmware has `ARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT` disabled so `Serial` output goes to UART0 (COM port), keeping flash and monitor on the same connector.

If upload fails with "Resource busy", a `screen` session may be holding the port:
```bash
lsof /dev/cu.usbmodem*   # find the PID
kill <PID>
```

Flash command:
```bash
pio run -t upload --upload-port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXXX
```

Serial monitor:
```bash
screen /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXXX 115200
# Exit: Ctrl+A, K, Y
```

## Web Dashboard + GeoJSON (current hack-relays workflow)

This branch now includes an operator-focused web dashboard served by the ESP32:

- `/` serves `data/index.html` (MapLibre + Chart.js UI)
- `/api/dashboard` returns dashboard JSON with embedded GeoJSON features
- `/api/relay?board=<id>&channel=<id>&state=<0|1>` toggles relay state and returns command result

### Scope clarification (important)

- This dashboard is a **simulation interface running on lab equipment**.
- It is designed to represent a **real field operating context** and field topology we are connected to through an operator relationship.
- It is **not** a 1:1 production deployment of the field control stack.
- In the current lab setup, **SSR channels 0–5** on board 0 drive the IoTMug bank (three tenant households × Primary + Secondary); **SSR 6–7** are unused in this mapping. Per-house data on the map still shows all 10 homes.

### What is shown in the dashboard

- Satellite basemap with site/court geometry
- House points (10 homes) with per-house relay state color:
  - **Green** = connected / relay ON
  - **Red** = disconnected / relay OFF
- A one-day simulated timeline per house (hourly kWh values)
- Relay controls with explicit action buttons:
  - **TURN ON** (green action button)
  - **TURN OFF** (red action button)

### GeoJSON notes

- House points are emitted as proper GeoJSON Point coordinates in `[lon, lat, z]` order.
- Site outline (`court`) and **three circuit** `LineString`s come from **`Circuit1.kmz`**, **`Circuit2.kmz`**, and **`Circuit3.kmz`** (Google Earth paths). Each path is converted at build time into `include/circuit_paths_generated.h` (run `python3 scripts/kmz_to_circuit_paths.py` manually, or rely on the PlatformIO `pre:` script). Aerial ribbon segments (`courtAir`) follow the same vertices.
- The current implementation uses one StreetPoleEMS board with 10 house points for visualization.
- Relay API / MQTT `channel` is **SSR index 0–5** (not per-house index 0–9). Houses on the same secondary circuit share one SSR state on the map.

### Deployment gotcha: upload filesystem content

If `/api/dashboard` works but `/` does not load the UI, upload SPIFFS filesystem assets:

```bash
pio run -t uploadfs --upload-port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXXX
pio run -t upload   --upload-port /dev/cu.usbmodemXXXXX
```

## Nearly Free Energy (Uganda) site-layout reference

The current court/house layout in the dashboard is based on the Nearly Free Energy Sezibwa Homes site-layout page (Uganda), then represented in GeoJSON for this ESP32 dashboard workflow.

- Source page: https://bookstack.nearlyfreeenergy.com/books/business/page/site-layout
- In this repo, house coordinates are embedded in `src/main.cpp` and exposed through `/api/dashboard`. LV circuit polylines are authored as KMZ next to `platformio.ini`, then baked into firmware as above.

When updating site geometry, keep the source-of-truth process simple:

1. Capture site coordinates (survey/GPS or engineering drawing export)
2. Store as `lat,lon` source data
3. Convert to GeoJSON output order `lon,lat`
4. For the three map circuits, edit `Circuit1.kmz`–`Circuit3.kmz` (one `LineString` path each), then rebuild so `circuit_paths_generated.h` updates
5. Validate by opening `/api/dashboard` and confirming house placement on satellite map

# EIOT.Energy EMS DER/Site Controller Dev Kit - OpenAMI Metering Application

## Overview
A development kit based on the ESP32S3 N16R8 DEV KIT C1 for energy management systems (EMS) with support for various communication protocols and peripherals. There are a few N16R8 40/42/44 pin layouts. Th EMS kit th \evariant where the rgbw led is top center mounted just below the WROOM ESP32S3 surface mount module. All variants will work except the pins layout differs. 

## Branch `hack-relays` (workshop / hackathon)

**Intent for this branch:** Keep **OpenAMI-style metering** as the base story, but prioritize a **simple operator path**: Modbus (or equivalent) **reads per feed**, plus **discrete relay / SSR control per customer** (e.g. 8-channel I2C relay bank on the NESL **EMS 865B** bring-up in **nesl-meshems**). Cloud topics and full lane-B networking stay **out of scope** until the local meter + relay loop is stable.

**Deliverable we want by end of hack:** Documented wiring, working toggle path from firmware to SSR outputs, and a clear mapping table (customer / meter id / relay channel) for field use.

## Features
This development kit supports multiple peripherals using the PlatformIO and Arduino framework:
- RS-485 MODBUS RTU communication
- CANBUS V2.0 interface via SPI
- Input buttons (using voltage divider array on analog GPIO)
- 1.3in OLED Display over SPI (SH1106)

### ⚠️ WARNING: AC Power Safety
### DANGER - RISK OF ELECTRIC SHOCK, SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH
This development kit includes a connection for AC power input. When working with AC power (especially 120V/240V mains voltage):

- **Professional Installation Required:** All AC power connections MUST be installed by a qualified electrician in accordance with local electrical codes and regulations.
- **Enclosure Mandatory:** When used with AC power connections, the device MUST be mounted in an appropriate, non-conductive enclosure with restricted access.
- **Safety Precautions:**
- **ALWAYS disconnect AC power** before making any changes to the wiring
- **NEVER touch any AC terminals** or components when power is connected
- Ensure proper grounding of all components
- Install appropriate circuit protection (fuses, breakers)
- Keep AC and DC/logic circuits strictly separate
**Not UL/CE Certified for AC Applications:** This development kit by itself is NOT certified for direct connection to AC mains.

**⚠️ Failure to follow these safety guidelines could result in severe electrical shock, fire, serious injury, or death. ⚠️**
